# About the game

The Game *Dye Bunny* is a infinite 2D side scroller.

The objective is to last for as long as possible. The player plays as a bunny that changes colour when you collect the *dye bottles*.
Use the arrow keys or W & S to move between your lanes of movement.

Collect eggs that are the same colour as you to gain points.

You will die if you collide with a black egg or an egg that is a different colour to you.
